10th December 1948 is a date that marks a milestone in the history of humankind. It was on this day that the Declaration of Universal Human Rights was adopted in the UN General Assembly. (The following article is an attempt to create awareness about Human Rights, with humour being a medium. The issue of human right violation is very serious and in no way is it intended to joke around about it.)

# **MANIT and its rightful violators**

Fast forward to 2019. At the very heart of the eccentric nation of India, right at 23.2146° N, 77.4051° E lies the lair of the crafty engineers (\*the jugadoos), MANIT. Don’t be fooled by its appearance, the lush green campus and the amazing views are a façade at best. A masterful attempt to screen its true face from the rest of the world. Residents however, are well aware of the true nature of all things. This place is crawling with monsters and thugs of varied kinds, none of which practice any restrain when trying to achieve whatever it is that they have set their eyes on, even if it means violating the basic rights of their fellow beings. So, BEWARE and keep your eyes peeled for the listed miscreants.

THE DISILLUSIONED THEIF:

For the hundredth time; NO, they are not kleptomaniacs. They are the dreaded ghosts who stroll in the hallways, looking for that perfect item to steal (\*they think of it as borrowing), and before you even know it, your brand-new T-shirt which costed you a whopping 3000rs is gone. Their insatiable desire to steal everybody else’s prized possessions is deeply rooted in their belief that friendship is a legitimate excuse to completely ignore the common courtesy of asking for permission before using others’ things. The wise ones know that locking up their cupboards is the best way to ensure that their RIGHT TO THEIR OWN THINGS remains protected.

**The Right to Your Own Things.** Everyone has the right to own things or share them. Nobody should take our things from us without a good reason.

THE SELF IMPOSED DEMAGOUGES:

They are the power hungry, self-appointed leaders of the covenant. Ever since their first encounter with the force that lies with the majestic titles, they have aspired to experience it all for themselves. And thus, would leave no stone unturned in an attempt to forge their way to the top. From bribery, to fear mongering they are willing to do all there is to ensure a seat at the table. I wish there was a way to preserve your RIGHT TO DEMOCRACY from them, but unfortunately there isn’t. You could only complain about the warped system, but we all know that that discussion doesn’t lead anywhere.

**The Right to Democracy.** We all have the right to take part in the government of our country. Every grown-up should be allowed to choose their own leaders.

THE VACATION BOMBERS:

They are abstract, just like their objectives. Just when you feel free of all worldly problems(\*academics), they sneak up on you to ruin your rarely available holidays (\*something that has recently happened, thanks to the 75% attendance rule). An assignment, however meagre it is, when given in time for Dussehra or Diwali vacations is more than enough to dampen anyone’s holiday spirits. These deceptive monsters have a nasty habit of cropping up when you are the least prepared for them. They also lend an individual’s RIGHT TO PLAY the status of a myth.

**The Right to Play.** We all have the right to rest from work and to relax.

THE INTELLECT ENCROACHERS:

Armed with a mesmerizing smile, a charming demeanour and a string of ‘please’, these demons apparate out of thin air, right at the day before any major submission is due.

As tedious and mentally straining completing practical files and assignments is, it is in all respects a true test of an individual’s patience. So, when after working hard day in and day out to be able to complete the assignments, the aforementioned demons spring up asking to copy your assignment, being engulfed by rage is inevitable. If only copyrighting was an easier process, you could have asked them to pay royalty in return for access to the document.  But unfortunately for you, hard work on your part will always make you vulnerable to such attacks on your intellectual property.

**Copyright.** Copyright is a special law that protects one’s own artistic creations and writings; others cannot make copies without permission. We all have the right to our own way of life and to enjoy the good things that art, science and learning bring.

THE FRESH-BLOOD HUNTERS:

These bloodthirsty vampires are always on the lookout for a new prey; someone who is gullible and easily intimidated. Don’t be so alarmed, it’s not like they bite. They are just too lazy to do their own work and thus resort to the age-old practice of slavery, in order to get their work done. The fear that they induce in their subordinates is what ensures that they always have someone or the other to do their bidding. With the advent of stricter laws, their numbers have depleted, but that is no reason to be careless.

**No Slavery.** Nobody has any right to make us a [slave](https://www.youthforhumanrights.org/what-are-human-rights/videos/no-slavery.html). We cannot make anyone our slave.
