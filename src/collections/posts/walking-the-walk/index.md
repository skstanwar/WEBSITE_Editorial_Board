A stroll through the park, a walk by the beach;  
Is nature’s way of bringing, happiness to our reach!  
The mist on fresh grass, your naked feet uncover;  
In unknown paths you get lost, and sometimes you discover.

Human beings have been walking since times immemorial and it is solely because of this capability that we have conquered this world. However in the past two decades, people have progressively moved towards modern transportation and in the process made walking obsolete. What was once the sole way of commute, especially for short distances, has now become “_another form of exercise_” best performed on fancy treadmills in gyms. So how is it possible that something, which the entire species had been doing since its inception, is now disappearing from the lifestyle of the modern 21st century man?

The daily recommended step count for a healthy individual is in the ballpark of around 10,000. Compare that with **4297** steps, which is what the average Indian walks daily, making Indians one of the laziest crowds in the world! Let that sink in for a while. It is true that with rapid economic advancements in the nation, there has been a high disregard for the need of green spaces and pedestrian amenities which would have otherwise incentivized people to walk more often. However, there is also a social perception in regard to the way one chooses to travel to their workplace. _And what better place to witness this than MANIT itself!_

MANIT is perhaps the only NIT which allows its students to own and operate a vehicle inside its campus on such a massive scale. There have been several attempts at banning the vehicles and all of them succumbed to the collective protests of students. **After all, possession of a bike or scooter is what really makes senior a “senior”, isn’t it?** The thrill of night-outs, dropping off your special one at H-7, rushing to Mata during breaks; all these luxuries are possible because of vehicles and they come **at the expense of walking.** The lack of necessary provisions in the college campus itself is inadmissible, but the real question here is this- would we be willing to give up our vehicles even if the institute sets up markets and arranges for buses inside the campus? And why just limit these restrictions to the students. How would the faculty residing inside the campus feel, if they had to compulsorily walk to their classes for a minimum number of days every week?

One might ask – “_So what if I am not walking as much as I should? After all, isn’t going for a walk something that old people enjoy when they have nothing better to do! I am a fit individual and strolling in the morning comes nowhere close to the deadlifts and planks that I’ll do when I hit the gym!_” The physiological benefits of walking are common knowledge and often replaceable with some other form of physical activity. But, what most people fail to realize is that there is more to walking than just burning a couple of hundred calories. **The MIT Press, Cambridge and several other research institutions have found strong co-relations between the creative abilities of a person and how often they walk as published in the Journal of Psychology, American Psychological institution\***.  One may choose to believe or refuse to accept this technical jargon but there have been several personages who have reaped the benefits of walking. From Robert Frost to Charles Dickens, from Einstein to Steve Jobs, they have all advocated for and swore by walking to overcome their creative hurdles in several aspects of life. Several DRDO scientists fondly remember how Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam loved his famed morning walks and used it as a tool, to develop his passion for poetry and his ideas for messages, later conveyed in several of his books.

The evidence in the favor of walking is overwhelming. And the good news is, one does not have to wait for six weeks to see the results! Whenever you are overwhelmed and everything seems to move too fast, a quiet and peaceful walk by yourself can help think you better and be at ease with everything. Maybe, the environment too can benefit much more from people choosing to walk over short distances daily, as compared to going for a marathon in the name of Clean India! _All said and done, **the beginning of any journey starts with just one step**, both literally and figuratively._
