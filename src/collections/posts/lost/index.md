A liquid bed,  
A bloody red,  
Lies beneath the corpse unknown,  
A similar red,  
A glittering thread,  
Decorates my canvas unbeknownst.  
With a fuzzy head,

Lost in unrest,  
I wonder about the corpse that lies,  
Piecing thoughts,  
I soothe my heart,  
With the notion that everyone dies.  
The voices of dread,

The news about the dead,  
Sing of wars and fights.  
With my headphones on,  
A metal song,  
Gives me hope all night.  
Ah! A dead neighbour,

All this emotional labour,  
I resist being unwound.  
Caught in the act,  
A pretentious pact,  
I risk being unsympathetically found.  
Between life and death,  
A vortex of bloodshed,

Envelopes my conscience whole.  
Now in effect,  
This daily outrage,  
Leaves me with a gaping hole.
