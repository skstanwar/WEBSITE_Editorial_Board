As the date for Ed-Search draws ever nearer, we thought to provide you with an insight into the inner-workings of the Editorial Board. So, starting our series of Alumni Interviews with the ever eccentric Sanjana Wadhwa, English Editor from 2012-2014, Joint Chief Editor for 2014-15, and currently working at Google, California.

**1) What were your reasons for joining the Editorial Board?** My reasons for joining EB weren't great. I had heard a bit about the alumni, and all my friends were going for Ed Search. It was one of those things that I did just out of curiosity, and turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me.

**2) Did it improve your college experience as a whole?** I built great relationships with people from EB. Some of my friends were in the team, and some teammates turned into my best friends. During college I always had something to be excited about.

**3) Did the experience of being a part of our team help you in any way in your career after college?** I got to interact with people studying for GRE, CAT, GATE, and people going for jobs. I got to interact with alumni that were already pursuing all of these. This gave me great exposure, and I reached out to EB alumni for guidance during my application process for Masters in USA.

**4) Finally, what is your favourite EB memory?** Memories with EB are too many to name! One of them is when we wanted to see off a beloved EB member to Delhi for vacation. We were outside Habibganj when his train left, and raced to Bhopal station in a car. Everyone was delighted to make it, and made me realize how strong the bonding is in the team. All of the crazy late night sessions close to publishing the magazine, and we always had to visit the Upper Lake after them. Or my EB farewell, that started around 6PM and ended the next day after breakfast, because all of us just wanted to sit and talk.

Finally, as an alumnus, I would advise you to try something new while you are there. You never know what might turn out to be a critical turning point of your life.
