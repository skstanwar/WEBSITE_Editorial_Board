A clan of Monsters, Dwelled by a quiet Hill. Feeding on Humans, Celebrating their kills.

Worshippers of Power, They tore and they looted. With fangs instead of teeth, They bit what they suited.

Though surrounded by suffering, The Monsters still rejoiced. The genesis of life, Hushed the sounds of their shrill voice.

In silence they stood, Embasked in moon light, The cries of the new born, Filled their hearts with delight.

Born at the darkest hour, The child was considered blessed. Though some feared, "The Onset of Unrest."

Though brimming with talent, The Gospel had prophesied, "With time the child might take, An unusual flight."

The child grew up, With a propensity for art, When introduced to someone, He knew how to win their heart.

Well versed in tradition, He hunted with skill. He revered his prey, By offering them swift kills.

Bound by culture, The boy had not explored. His coming of age demanded him, To abandon all that he had adored.

Though the boy had plundered, Quite a many animal nests, Never had he experienced, Mankind's Protest.

Bestowed with responsibility, The boy stood perplexed. The thought of hunting Humans, Made him feel hexed.

On the night of the hunt, He failed his mates. The boy was not seen, Shut were all the gates.

Though ostracised, Some still cared. They longed for his return, With a ripe Human mare.

Lacking a leader, The Monsters fell apart. With the waking of the Dragon, Fear struck all their hearts.

With the flap of his wings, He created lightning sparks. His fiery breath, Set ablaze the dark.

With claws of steel, He clenched the Hilltop. The Monsters below, Could only pray for their misery to stop.

Trembling in fear, Their eyes closed shut, The Monsters below, Were surprised by a putt.

In the blink of the eye, The Dragon was slain. What seemed like witchcraft, Was indeed an aeroplane.

Celebrations ensued, As the aircraft landed. Unaware of their saviour, The Monsters felt stranded.

As the door opened, An eerie silence spread, The anonymous saviour, Was none other than the boy who had fled.

Apologising for his past, He elicited his heart bare. "It is not fear but kindness, That we all share."

Narrating his story, He told how he met, The accommodating Humans, That had granted him this jet.

He argued with all his might, Speaking of cooperation and what's right. Stating that how it was not bravery, But empathy that was missing that night.

Though initially hostile, The Monsters soon accepted, To dwell in peace, Which seemed quite unexpected.

Even today, The Humans and the Monsters don't fight, But they all do recite, The legends of that boy's flight.

A clan of Monsters, Dwells by a quiet Hill. Feeding with Humans, Celebrating their kills.
