> Inspired by a telephone conversation with Rajesh Tiwari, a mechanical engineering graduate of 1986, currently working with Royal Dutch Shell in Oman.

We were loathed. The very sight of a maroon blazer was enough to put shopkeepers, bus conductors and cinema owners on their guard. But that was soon to change. We were to show that our true colours were much more than the colour maroon.

It was a cold winter night in December. Tensions between Hostel 5 and Hostel 6 were at a new high. A confrontation was expected at night, so we kept our rods and bats and hockey sticks at an arm’s reach. We were supposed to warn our neighbour by tapping on the wall three times, which was our code for distress. Then, suddenly at around 1 at night, we heard a lot of footfalls and a huge uproar. “Tak….tak…tak…” went the sound of the walls. This was it. This was war! We rushed out with our sticks and rods raised over our heads and screaming at the top of our voices. But no! Instead of “6 numberies,” we saw infirm women, men and small children collapsing to the floor, coughing, and out of breath. The chaos and confusion were apparent. The first rumour was that Pakistan had attacked our country. While we tended to the poor folks, speculations were still on as to what had caused this strange occurrence. Soon, the blue tempo van of our college arrived and the college authorities informed us about a gas leakage in Old Bhopal. This wasn’t a petty battle, nor was this war. This was a tragedy in the making. It was what would be known as the infamous _Bhopal Gas Tragedy._

We were told to put wet handkerchiefs on our faces to mitigate any ill effects. In the morning, all NCC and NSS cadets and those who wished to volunteer headed towards Gandhi Medical College in Old Bhopal in our yellow bus. The sights on the way were appalling. Dogs were dying, beggars had collapsed and havoc prevailed. The sad part was that the authorities rushed away from the scene, and there was little official help. We were on our own. This was where we showed the true spirit of MACT. Working 12 to 14 hours a day, our volunteers helped distribute antacid tablets, put in eye drops, put up tents, provided water and distributed food. We had little resources, and medicines were meant more as placebo than actual medication. However, they did work and assuaged the sufferings of many. The third day, we were told to break open house doors to bring out the dead bodies. The stench was unbearable. It was a bad feeling to see people lying dead on the floor of their own homes. It was a sad feeling to see them dying in our own hands.

A few days later, while in the hospital, a bunch of commandos suddenly came in and started clearing us out of the rooms. When questioned, they told us that it was to clear the room for Mr. Rajiv Gandhi who wanted to see the victims. We were furious and would not move. Eventually, even the armed commandos and Mr. Rajiv Gandhi had to bow to our adamance, and one representative from each college was to stay in the room. Mr. Rajiv Gandhi asked us if he could do anything for us. Those were the days when there were no mobile phones and phone services were virtually non-existent at that point of time. So, all we asked of him was to announce on the All India Radio that we were all fine, so that our families could come to know of this and stop worrying. This was done. In fact, it was done very frequently from that day onwards and the entire country was updated on the incident.

Soon, it was time to go home. Weary and eager to see our families we boarded our respective trains. I had 40 rupees in my pocket, and the ticket cost 37 rupees. I travelled in the general compartment.

When we all came back, the maroon blazer was no longer hated. We were heroes. We were respected. People had now seen our true colours. People had seen our true spirit. And this is what MACT was about and I wish it remains the same for the times to come.
