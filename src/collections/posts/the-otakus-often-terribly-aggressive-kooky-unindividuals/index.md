There are several curious incidents, which we as humans dismiss casually as inevitable. Anime fans, a loose term casually flung everywhere, seem to be one of those eccentricities. Assuredly, there is at least one of these in our lives. Reactions to this class of kingdom Animalia however, vary. To the uninitiated, they are simply terrifying, horrifying and disgusting. BUT! To alleviate this misconception, we have put together a brief list of the types of anime watchers, which can also serve as a handy guide to avoid deal with them:

# 1\. The Curious:

These are the most simple, and the happiest fans. They’re only just curious, about the outside world. An occasional dose of Haikyuu, few tears shed after epic inspiring shonen monologues (The very essential training journey in the mountains after the loss of a loved one), an occasional episode of Sket Dance, these MANITians are balancing the tightrope beautifully, neither rejecting the exquisite art form, nor giving up on other beautiful things in life.

# 2\. The Otaku:

These creatures have a slightly higher dose of obsession. _Slightly._ With anime posters covering their wall, body pillows of Hatsune Miku, anime figurines, and an _unhealthy_ obsession with Cardcaptor Sakura, these individuals are more inclined to stay huddled in their rooms, watching anime as opposed to drinking chai at Mata. They prefer 2D to 3D, and I don’t think any one of them has regretted that decision yet. Unfortunately, these individuals might come off as a bit strong, and the best course of action usually is to leave them to their devices.

# 3\. The Screenslavers:

They are deceptively patient, they are aggressive, and they know what they want, which is to settle in Japan and become a mangaka (a scary term!) They live anime, they breathe anime and they know the exact number of jutsus used by Naruto (an _irrelevant_ detail. “HOW DARE THOU! HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN-”) It is also their life ambition to bring you down the same path. (“It all started with that ONE episode.”). The most dangerous of their kind, they are an explosive community of people who need to be closely monitored and strictly controlled.

And lastly dear reader, there are those innocents, blissfully unaware of the existence of these individuals peacefully coexisting with humanity (for now!), secretly plotting to convert and covet said rare, pure souls. Be afraid, be very afraid. They’re coming to get you.
