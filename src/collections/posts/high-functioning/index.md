It's mostly dark in here. Everything seems to be adrift in a shapeless space. I often find myself floating too. Just wading through stuff. It's almost like a ritual to me. Waking up.

I still don't understand all the darkness that surrounds this place, amongst other things, of course. Wait till I tell you about them phantoms. I often feel them, these faceless projections, circling around me. I guess they are part people, silhouettes of old buddies. But buddies stick around, don't they? Phantoms, don't.

Sometimes, it's lonely. Other times, loud. I still don't understand how sound works in this place. It's almost like a full body sensation. Tingly at times, painful often. Sucks to be into Metal.

Whatever it is, wherever I am, I try to stay happy. Happy? Wait, what is that? I think knowing doesn't make a difference. To know is to control. But this place has no concept of knowledge, or control. But I guess you could say I am happy. Well, whatever.

Yesterday, there was a burst of light. Yesterday? LIGHT!!! To see, what an amazing feeling. Momentary specks of colour, shapes, combinations, motion, blinding yet fascinating. I wonder what it must be like for others? Them phantoms, could they see? Me? Ah! To be seen, what a wonderful possibility.

It's dark again, and awfully quiet. Is this the end? Is there an end? I miss company. It's always empty in here, but it's the first time I feel empty inside. Inside? It's difficult to tell. I can't tell whether I have substance. Not the figurative kind. Shut up, already.

I saw flashes of memory today. People, real people. Me? I couldn't tell. Blood? Lots. I could feel the sound again. Screams. Laughter. Where was this? Where am I? I couldn't breathe. I felt it, the darkness growing darker. The phantoms, uneasy, chaotic even. I wanted it to stop. I wanted that to stop.

Suddenly there was light. Bright, almost burning. One of the phantoms, shoved something in my mouth. I swallowed hard and everything started fading away. I don't recall what happened next, or before that. Was I crying? But I always thought I was happy. Nevermind.

I barely wake up anymore. This has never happened before. What has? I often dream about otherwordly things. I don't understand most of them. There are a bunch of people laughing, they seem happy. And then there is me, standing in a corner. Am I sad? Was I sad?

One of the phantoms spoke to me today. I couldn't make much of it, but he certainly mentioned someone nearing Heathrow. What's Heathrow? Is it a bird, is it a plane? Nevermind, good for them. That rhymed. I am a fucking artist. Maybe, not. What am I?

It's one of those quiet days again. But my insides feel weird. As if everything is about to disappear. Is this what they call paranoia? Am I paranoid? They always said I was. They? My head hurts.

The phantoms have stopped visiting, my head's clearing up. I can see again. I guess my eyes have adjusted to the dark. Are these walls? Why can't I reach them? Cuffs? For real? Am I in prison?

I guess I have been drugged several times. I still can't recall why I am here, but this certainly seems like a prison. Is this some sort of misunderstanding? I am a decent man. I have already shouted that several times. Good lord. Save me.

"B-221, take him out." The door cracked open. I saw a grizzly man. The first in centuries. How long had it been? My eyes swelled up. As I started to blurt a slurry of syllables, my world froze. "Your time's up. Any last wishes?" An old man in a lab coat, cut him short. "He's still unstable from the Valium. You should probably end it. If we give him any more time, his mind will force itself to recall what happened. If he regains his memories, we won't be able to control him. He could be a threat to all of us."

Last wishes? Valium? A threat? Me? As I tried to piece things together, something inside me broke. It opened up the floodgates of my memories along with it. I knew who I was. I knew who I am. I had a family. I burst out laughing. That scared the shit out of everyone else. I was back.

Before I could embask in my existence, I was strapped to a chair. The chair. I could hear them plug in the electrodes. I was nervous, excited even. Afraid? Hahahahaha. I could see familiar faces across the room, behind a glass pane. Some sad, some angry, all funny. Hahahahaha. Petty people, always seeking control. I spat at them. One lousy brat railed at me, "You killed them!" Hahahahaha.

I killed them. I? There was no 'I.' They always mocked me. I couldn't take it anymore. I loved them. "Love?" he asked hysterically. Hahahahaha. It's a deranged concept. They never saw me for who I am. Always expecting me to be someone else. Always wanting for me, thinking for me, blinding me. Always seeking control. I just reciprocated. Gave them a dose of their own medicine. 'They,' killed themselves. It was fun to see them at the reciever's end. Hahahahahahahaa!

Before I could finish, they wrapped a cloth over my face. For a moment, I felt the same peace I felt when I was unaware. How beautiful was that? That darkness. This darkness. Now only one question remained, between then and now, who was I? I could just make out the answer, before the currents zapped.

The guards mumbled to each other. "And there goes another sociopath." Another guard responded, "But he was unlike any. I guess, that's what you call people like him, yes."

High Functioning.
