# Epicurean Ecstasies : And Where To Find Them

What is the purpose of life if not to explore and savour exquisite delicacies? Since times immemorial, food has been an integral part of our lives. From discovering fire to experimenting with crops, food has always propelled us towards the future. It has emerged as an industry revolutionising its patrons every step of the way. Food has indeed come to define life and the definition is as beautiful as biryani. The platter of life though filled with infinite variations is cyclic and repetitive. But as hedonistic as we are, finding satisfaction in the ordinary withers us away. They say there are distinct dishes for every emotion and thus there is hope; for all we have to do, is find a dish for the dissatisfaction that now growls in our bellies. Be it tender chicken appetisers, succulent, juicy and cooked to perfection or steaming sizzlers, as colourful as a painting, oozing out an invitation to dive right in; we’ve got you covered. After hours spent on gathering funds from gullibly generous sponsors {Read : Board and Treats} and taste testing at stalls and fine-dines alike, here’s a day-to-day guide to break free from the ordinary and give your taste buds a jolt of joy.

# Mushy Mondays:

Mondays are as gloomy as it gets. Be it the not so gentle alarm clock buzzing in your ears or the long hours spent in transit slowly draining all your energy; Monday’s deserve rejuvenating refreshments. A piping hot bowl of soul accompanied with a fulfilling meal full of condiments might invigorate you almost instantly. **_Author’s Recommendations :_**

# Tempting Tuesdays:

Tuesdays are all about restraint. Be it the religious restrictions on meat or the economical ones on the pocket; Tuesdays require you to settle for the best. Though it might seem tough on the brain it certainly isn’t on the stomach. A protein rich vegetarian compromise accompanied with a chilled beverage to gulp it down might just be enough to provide some comfort in all this confusion. _**Author’s Recommendations :**_
