**“You don’t have to run faster than the bear to get away. You just have to run faster than the guy next to you.”-Jim Butcher**

Having or displaying a strong desire to be more successful than others, competition is an inevitable part of our life and  is deeply rooted in our evolutionary heritage. Since the stone age, men have competed for food, shelter, mates and other biological resources.  Multiple theories, including Darwin’s natural selection theory, have suggested that the struggle for survival is an inherent human trait which determines a person's success. Thus, competition is a natural state of being and  that’s what we humans, as social animals, do. But should every person be fiercely competitive? Maybe. We know that competition leads to greatness and other good things but is there a limit?

Well, think about that classmate of yours, who submits the assignment when no-one else does. Or the one who fights for that 1 mark even though he still is the topper. Or that society member, who is always kissing the senior’s ass to get a high post. Just the thought makes you go _\*beep beep beep\*._ Even though many a times, we might benefit from being overly competitive, there always are some drawbacks. And we might not even be aware of that and how they affect us. The following text contains some of those drawbacks.

**Fear**

There’s no denying that competitions tend to be more fun if you win. But there is always an unconscious fear of failure. This fear is the chief cause for competitors to back out or quit. Also, the fear of failure just leads to more failure. And then it's a vicious cycle.

**Loneliness**

“Know your competition and their weaknesses”, we’re told. Not to understand them, but to overcome them. This prevents us from opening up to people. We orient ourselves to others by looking for advantage and thus ruining or relations with others. So we are left with an overwhelming sense of loneliness.

**Unbalanced Life**

We feel so much pressure to succeed in a particular field that they put everything else on hold. This may lead to unbalanced living or force us to give up our interests.

**Restlessness**

If you're a competitive person, then you won’t be satisfied after succeeding in one of the goals. You'll soon find another goal to work on. As ideal and positive as that sounds, this may affect your social life. For they will see everyone as mere pawns in the game of chess and they fail to appreciate the people who really care.

**Attention**

This is sometimes the sole reason for people to compete. Since birth, we seek attention of our parents and try to gain a preference over our siblings. As we grow up, we seek attention of people around us. This leads to the condition when our mind is seeking respect and acclaim miles away from the voices and concerns of those we can hear and touch.

**Self value**

When we succeed in something, most of us can’t help but boast about it. We try to impress people by our achievements that which tend to prove our importance. What we don’t see is that instead of attracting others we start to repel them. This gives an impression that  our accomplishments are the only part of us that matter. And we spend an enormous amount of time trying to get noticed and appreciated, to remind ourselves that we are special.

**Social comparison**

We humans are propelled by a basic drive to be better than the others. Instead of focusing on our strengths, we try to find our opponent's weaknesses. We instead of connecting with them, try to beat them. This ruins our relationship with that person as we just see them as a competition and nothing more.

It is true, that in today’s world, you can’t help but face competition, as there is no succeeding without competing.  But this thirst to win, to succeed, often blinds us and makes it difficult to engage in relationship of care. It lessens sensitivity towards others, drawing us away from the ones closest to us. We no longer trust each other and are left with suspicion and hesitancy. We concentrate more on our competitors than ourselves and forget about our own goals and needs.

So yes, there is a limit. And it is upon us to draw the line. Though competition has various downfalls, it is a necessity in our lives. It is a culturally created aspect of human behaviour, and its prevalence in a particular society is relative to how the society values it.
