# My Experience With Bhopal Pride 2018:

Perspective is a funny thing. Things you know to be absolute truths are sometimes the first to fall like dominoes when they shift even slightly. Bhopal is boring. India is intolerant. These were irrefutable "facts" I stubbornly clung to. But a little bit of pride was all it took to wash all that away.

I went to my first pride parade on July 15, 2018. For the uninformed, pride parades are events that celebrate the LGBTQ culture, while also advocating for legal reform to help include these individuals better in mainstream society. I had heard about it from a friend, who posted a status on his social media handles. I had always been curious about prides, and had always been excited by the idea of going to one someday. But I'd never expected to go to one in sleepy old Bhopal. Delhi or Mumbai seemed more like it. I was as excited as I was apprehensive. I pictured a good old fashioned lathi-charge, or at least to be mocked and jeered by those around. All my friends had bailed on me, which meant I was going alone. And secretly, this was my biggest fear of all . Do I belong here? Would I be accepted?

Needless to say, I was wrong on all counts. Arriving at our very own Amer bakery hut, I made friends almost immediately, in a parking spot of all places. After bonding over a long drawn effort to find someplace where our vehicles wouldn't be towed, I was wordlessly handed a pair of flashy, prop sunglasses, and we made our way to the slow moving parade.

Are parades supposed to be fun? I'm not quite sure. But I can say without a shadow of a doubt, that I enjoyed myself. I fluttered the huge flag, joked and laughed with my new friends, and even held the giant multicolored balloon float for a time.For all the levity and color, the slogans we chanted belied the seriousness of the issues we were raising. And within that seriousness too, were the seeds of hope, not helplessness.

> "I am gay, that's okay. You're not, and that's okay. "

What surprised me the most, in all this, was nothing to do with the parade itself, but the people in and around it. Where I expected to see only college students, middle aged and older men and women walked right alongside us. The parade was stared at, true, but without any judgment or ire. Just simple curiosity, which I'm sure would one day blossom into awareness. Where I'd expected to be herded and harassed by the police, they simply helped keep the parade moving . There was so poignant, wonderful examples of open heartedness , that I lost track. A little girl pranced along, holding a rainbow colored umbrella, while her mother proudly looked on. People made way for us on the busy streets during peak traffic. When asked by a passerby whether were doing some sort of project, I hemmed and hawed and did not answer the question directly. When I finally told him what pride was all about, he said that we were working for a great cause, and that he'd be totally fine with it if his children were LGBTQ. I know. I was as elated and surprised as you are.

For sure,we have a long way to go in terms of legislation and reform. But for just a few moments, I was unabashedly proud to live in a country where I could stand up for the values I espoused, while being completely accepted by the residents of the city I lived in. And I could never say Bhopal is boring with a straight face again. How could it be, with all this vibrancy and life?

As the parade neared it's end, I struck up a conversation with someone walking beside me. We connected almost instantly, joking and laughing about college, and about our lives in general. In the middle of the conversation, he asked me whether I was gay, because he thought I was cute. For someone who's always been a bit insecure about the way he looks, this comment was unbearably sweet. I gave him a big hug and said, no, I'm not, and thanked him for the self confidence boost. I'd made a friend for life. And also memories for a lifetime.
