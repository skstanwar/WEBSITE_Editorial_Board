**_Dzzz.... My phone vibrated. A text popped up on the screen. Simple, yet enough to get my heart racing. No, not in the “butterflies in the stomach” way. I wish. This was something else  The results were finally out. Mumbling a quick prayer under my breath, I opened the PDF._**

**NOT CLEAR**

**_Well…. Settle in. Because I'm about to tell you the story of my life (Umm...not exactly). More specifically, why my life ended(which is a possibility after my parents come to know about this). And if you're reading this, you might understand why._**

**13 REASONS WHY**

**I Failed The Exams**

REASON 1:

The plan was to study after a quick nap (stupid, agreed), which failed miserably (obviously) and so did I. (Thanks to the snooze option of the alarm).

REASON 2:

You're all set for the exam. You sit on the desk. The invigilator gives you the question paper. And then you realise….. You studied for the wrong exam.

REASON 3:

So, after entering the exam room, you realise that you have to sit on the first bench **and** you forgot your _pharre_ in the room.

REASON 4:

We all have that one (at least) unlucky bastard whose birthday comes during the exam. And so the celebrations begin…. (If you know what I mean)

REASON 5:

Cause your girlfriend/ boyfriend needed attention (eye roll.)

REASON 6:

Since it is an unspoken rule to complete your incomplete TV series/ Manga or novel a day before the exam, you can't just break the tradition.

REASON 7:

Tired and sleepy from studying all night, you start writing the first answer. You feel someone shaking you. And you realise… You slept while writing the paper.

REASON 8:

With hopeful eyes and a roughly completed syllabus, you walk in with a thud of confidence only to realise that your past sins aren't washed away yet. (Yes, you've been detained.)

REASON 9:

When you are separated from your lifeline (the person whom you copy from) and now you can't breathe (answer the questions.)

REASON 10:

Remember that professor who has a grudge against you because of your antics in his class… Well karma is a bitch (and so is he/she.)

REASON 11:

Because your roommate has completed their course and so obviously, won't let you study.

REASON 12:

Since the study leave for the last exam was _utilised_ in making plans for after the exams. (Which never took place)

REASON 13:

Well, because you didn’t study for the paper.
