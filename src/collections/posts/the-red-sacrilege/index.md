Borne in blood,
A mushy mutt,
Grew conscious of his own.
With wings of death,
A bloody red,
Levitated to fall alone.
Begrudging mutt,
Wounded and shut,
Sought recluse in stories unknown.
Yelping cries,
Gathering supplies,
He built a shrine to atone.
Gullible mutts,
Loathed and hurt,
Heard laurels of shrine divine.
With feeble hearts,
Afraid of snarks,
Their fates intertwined.
Bloody mutt,
Deluded and pert,
Ordered the vengeance wine.
With eyes closed shut,
Blindfolded by purpose,
They feasted together, they dined.
Drunk on words,
The bloody mutts,
Transgressed across the times.
Emboldened by ranks,
Unafraid, unshamed,
They grew familiar of crime.
Now unheard,
The mutts still flirt,
Through the exchange of meager dimes.
In similar shrines,
In suits and ties,
They camouflage, they mime.
