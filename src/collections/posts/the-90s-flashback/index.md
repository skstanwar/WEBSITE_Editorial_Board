We have all grown up during the 90’s and everybody would agree that some amazing cartoons filled up our childhood. Let us take a second to dig into the murky recesses of our early memories and reminisce about the shows we grew up watching. The funny, wacky shows provided a good laugh to brighten up a tough day. Here is an attempt to jog through our childhood.

**Tom and Jerry**

Remember the roar of the lion at the outset of every episode? Even in a dreary situation, that roar always made you forget your woes and look forward to the slapstick comedy.

In the Tom & Jerry world, anything imaginable and unimaginable is possible – characters taking the shape of a pipe on passing through it; an iron falling on the head; Tom’s tail set on fire; a lit stick of dynamite in Tom’s mouth, where it explodes; Tom shooting himself in the head with a shotgun; Jerry slamming a red-hot waffle iron shut on Tom’s tail; Jerry slicing Tom’s tail to shreds with a pair of scissors – you name it, and the show had it.

While Tom teaches us to be optimistic, Jerry establishes that no matter how small, you can still be a nuisance!

**The Power-puff Girls**

Sugar, spice, and everything nice. These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girls.

But Professor Utonium accidently added an extra ingredient to the concoction- CHEMICAL X !!

Thus, the Power-puff Girls were born. Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup were called upon by the Mayor of Townsville to fight Mojo JOJO, Fuzzy Lumpkins, Sedusa, the Rowdyruff Boys, and other forces of evil. They were role models. In a TV atmosphere where females were projected as damsels in distress, it’s nice to see that “once again, the Power-puff Girls save the day!”

**Popeye the sailor man**

Popeye is a good-guy underdog with oversized forearms, a corncob pipe and a penchant for spinach. The only thing he loves more than spinach is his flighty girlfriend, Olive.

His theory is simple. If you stumble into a conflict, gulp down a can of spinach, and you gain superhuman energy to thwack your enemy. This muscle packed character got so popular that Popeye was conceived for marketing canned spinach as a super-vegetable!

Eat spinach, my friend! Eat up!

**Ed, Edd and Eddy**

An analogy can be drawn between this show and a project group- one guy who pretends to work, one who works, and one who has no idea what is happening. These three are constantly trying to make money so that they can buy the ‘jawbreakers’(or laddoooo as some might remember it).

**Johnny Bravo**

Loads of hair gel, black shirt, blue jeans, glasses, and an ‘over muscular’ body!

Yo mama! Enter Johnny Bravo. He’s the guy who taught us cheesy pick up lines and gave us the definition of the DUDE!

**The Roadrunner Show**

It teaches us that:

1. ACME is the most innovative company in the Roadrunner world.
2. Gravity starts acting the moment you look down.
3. A falling anvil will always land directly upon the character’s head, regardless of the time gap between the body’s and the anvil’s respective drops.
4. On a serious note, it teaches us to never give up!

**Takeshi’s Castle**

It started with the General yelling ‘aiyaaee’ and everybody running towards The Great Wall via Skipping Stones, Honey Comb, Skittles, High Rollers, Bridge Ball, to the Finale – the Laser War!

Javed Jaffrey’s unbeatable comic timing made it hilarious besides all shouts, shrieks and moans of the participants. Considering that everything was padded and safe, there was only one injury that they sustained, extreme humiliation.

**Pokemon**

Studying, sleeping, eating, and playing: every activity had to be finished until 5:00 pm! The biggest anticipation of the day: Which song will we get to sing today? And “who’s that Pokemon?” before the break!

Ash, Misty, Brock, Pikachu, and Togepi visit exotic lands, collecting Pokeballs, golden Pokeballs, and badges. Why don’t we feel drowsy when Jigglypuff sings? How can Brock see through the two slits as eyes? What is the physics behind Misty’s ponytail up in the air? How does the Team Rocket defy gravity?

Though these doubts still prevail, Pokemon surely played a notable role in the skyrocketing sales of Uncle Chips, the reason being the free tazos.
