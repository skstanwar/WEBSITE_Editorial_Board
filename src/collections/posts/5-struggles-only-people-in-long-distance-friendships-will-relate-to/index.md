No (wo)man is an island. Human beings are supported by many invisible hands. Every time we seek to take a misstep, or take one and regret the consequences, these invisible hands support us, guide us, and dust us off until we take a step in the right direction. These invisible hands are family, and sometimes even more importantly, friends. Because as every other clich√© post on Instagram screams, friends are indeed our chosen family. Solitary creatures like me don't get the advantage of many friends. What with my social awkwardness and grumpy disposition, I have a barrier up a mile high that scares off most normal people into thinking I'm perpetually angry with them. It takes a special kind of weird to get past my barriers and get to the mushy creature waiting inside. At that point, I've made a friend for life. Unfortunately, not all of those wonderful weirdos I call my friends are a stone's throw away. Some are states, and some entire countries away. I even have a secret formula : Friendship = Time spent together/(Distance)^2 But there are exceptions to every rule, and this rule is no different. Some weather the challenges of distance, and miraculously manage to send a text my way every now and then. These near mythical creatures are my long distance friends. It's not always easy to keep in touch, however, even when you want to. There are always problems along the way, no matter how close you are...

## 1) Your vacations never match :

There's a special place in hell where Goa plans go to die. Starry eyed after watching Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, you make plans to meet up in exotic locations. Vacations come and go, but as if there are some nefarious forces at play, they never seem to match. Disappointed, you go home, taking some comfort in knowing that you will finally, finally see your friend. A phone call arrives. "Yaar, meri intern lag gai. I'll be in Bangalore this vacation." The gods must be against you.

## 2) You have to shout at each other over a phone because of bad network :

You twist around in your hostel room, doing fancy yoga positions, phone in hand. Despite your best efforts, the voice on the other end is only pale, garbled imitation. Just as things settle down, and finally a coherent conversation is taking place, surprise , surprise, your call magically gets cut.

## 3) The pain of platonic jealousy when you see them making new friends :

You have new friends, and have great fun in your new life. Despite this, you can't help but feel a pang of jealousy when you see your long distance friend having fun with different people. So petty, but oh so real.

## 4) The pain of watching them go through difficult times when you can't be there to help them out :

You receive a call at midnight. Your friend has just had a breakup. You listen, helplessly as they detail the the punishing story of how they were betrayed, broken and hurt. You rage, silently, at their pain, but know that all you can do is listen.

## 5) The anxiety of realizing, no matter how hard you hold on, one day you might have to let go :

You watch as the messages get shorter and less frequent. They talk about things that you really can't relate to, and things you now adore only seems to confuse them. You're still friends, and you love each other, but you always worry, deep down, whether your friendship will weather the distance.

Despite all this, it's so worth it when plans finally match, you meet up, and pick up just where you left off. You always have someone to bitch to, about all the strange people you put up with on a daily basis, someone who's totally objective because they are not involved in the day to day drama of your life. You motivate, cheer on, and comfort each other from a distance, and sometimes, that's all you need to get through the day. You don't necessarily talk to each other every single day, but that's okay too, because as a wise friend of mine once said, "You've changed, and I've changed. But we haven't."
