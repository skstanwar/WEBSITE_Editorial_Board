As ecstatic as love is, it is equally rare. But the essence of love lies in the struggle to attain it. Indeed, the journey is more beautiful than the destination. The path of love is full of thorns though. But they say for a man intoxicated with love, pain and pleasure go hand in hand; quite literally. I am sure, you must’ve experienced it too. Here in MANIT, we all go through the same struggle, be it the infamous _Lotas_ or the unruly _Mechis_, love tests us all.

From secretly following her to the hostel to desperately trying to get your request accepted, the playground of love is laden with several landmines. While most us can’t muster the courage to confess our feelings, some of the _Veer Bahadur Launde_, in all their bravado end up being blocked for displaying excessive affection {Read : Hi QT}, further increasing the terror of rejection. While simple pleasures like stalking her Instagram or assuming coincidences to be destiny, can motivate these soldiers of love, the desires of a female heart still elude our minds. Being constantly fazed by dismal thoughts, our soldiers or rather _Hunters_ often end up hurting their sentiments and losing all hope.

But no more. From the alleys of H7 and the tables of Chai and More, we bring to you the accounts of soldiers who conquered this war and came to experience what has always evaded us, a female perspective. So, before you finish that love letter written in blood or buy her pink princess apparel, do read on to know what she really wants.

## Transparency over Protection (except in one context) :

> “I am not staring at her, I am just looking out for her.” {Read : Medieval Ages}

Justifying the act of staring under the banner of assuring safety is as good a facade as campus placements, everybody knows that it’s a farce.

Offering protection is just like saying that we are weak, which is the gravest mistake one can make. First, they try to display their masculinity by acting tough around their friends but when the time comes to confront reality they get limp and resort to indecent acts like staring. It’s not resilience of the body that we desire (maybe sometimes, we do, but that comes a lot later) but it’s the resilience of heart.

Someone who respects us and has the courage to talk about how he feels is way more attractive than someone who offers to care from the shadows, creepily watching over us all the time.

## Space over “Chaand-Taare” :

> “Should I text her for the 53rd time? I mean, she might have been too busy to notice my texts.” {Read : Arvind Kejriwal}

No, women don’t demand attention, at least not from strangers. And yes, we value efforts but only as long as they don’t infringe upon our space.

For us, concepts matter more than formulae, someone who understands when to draw a line and who is patient enough often leaves a better impression than those who are foolishly persistence (except in one context, but that comes later).

Though some women see love as a conquest that can be beseeched, it is largely accepted that a little ignorance and time can truly do wonders to a female heart. So all you restless beasts out there, remember, patience over persistence.

## Reliability over Disability :

> “Maybe if I zoom past her, she might notice my barely visible face.” {Read : The Flash}

As much as India appreciates Rahul Gandhi, we appreciate bikes. Also, wearing a helmet might make you look more sensible if not attractive.

It’s difficult to comprehend how men look at us. Maybe it’s because of movies like Race that its celebrated audience (Bhai Fans) think that all women desire wealth and dream of an action packed, risky lifestyle. Keeping Bhai fans apart, it’s heart-breaking to see men try so hard only to rise in our books.

But the secret of success lies in humility and settlement. A person who is humble and stable generally sways us more than someone who sets up a gaudy display of artifacts but has no virtues to fall back upon.

## Clarity over Clairvoyance :

> “She smiled at me that day, I am sure she loves me.” {Read : The Joker}

Being Superman instead of Clark Kent can be dangerous at times. After all, who likes a know it all? The sad part is that they are usually cute.

We women, cherish liberty as much as men cherish beards. Though we might appreciate surprises and love to have you complete our sentences, imposing your choices on us and mansplaining is a strict no-no.

The problem with men is that they are impulsive and contrary to common conceptions, overly sentimental. The simplest solution to this is self-restraint and moderation accompanied by thoughtfulness and rationality.

## Piety over Possession :

> “How dare did she talk to him, doesn’t she see my efforts? She is mine and mine alone.” {Read : K..K..K..K..Kiran}

Men need to realize that not every psychopath is as cute as SRK in Darr and even if he is, obsessing over someone to the extent of insanity is unhealthy and iniquitous.

We women are not objects that can be acquired and anyone who treats us like that is only looked at with disgust and contempt. It’s insane how men go against our interests claiming to be working for our best interests without our consent.

Someone who hurts those around us and portrays himself as our sole companion just pushes us away while doing so. On the other someone who genuinely respects our interests even if they are against them, truly stands out from the rest.

The complexities of the female heart might have stultified you, but don’t lose heart. While change might be difficult, it will definitely be for the best. Though the tunnel of love might be dark and disheartening, the torch of wit and humour might ease your trepidation and as you move ahead more aids will eventually emerge along the way. Though the journey might be more beautiful, the destination is equally rewarding if not more. So before you lose yourself to lust and desperation and end up embarrassing yourself, remember this adage :

> “The flower doesn’t go to the bee; it blossoms and the bee comes.”
