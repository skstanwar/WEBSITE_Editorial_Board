    I am an architecture undergrad who is easily fascinated by anything archaic. My ideal evening constitutes a comfy bed, a classic novel and my cat snuggled close to me.
    <br />
    By the time you read this, I would probably succumb to the temptation of watching another movie.

    A slothful food nerd and dog lover powering through life one caffeinated beverage at a time.

    The celebration of food - the joy of creating something delicious - has always been, and continues to be, one of the finer pleasures of my life.
    <br />
    And yes - I might not look like it but I eat cake for breakfast. If you enjoy good music with delectable ;) food and great company then you have got a friend in me :)

    I’m one of those people who always try to switch cookies with salads. I would like to give some gyaan about philosophy, people and life. My soul animal is sloth bear - eat, sleep and repeat. Ah, I’m in a monotonous relationship with architecture, the propinquity of cheap life and expensive equipment. Yearning for timelessness between random stress cycles, existing to predict the unpredictable.

    I am an impatient soul, partly because everything interests me but nothing holds me. I like exploring and learning new things. Being lost in the process of creating art gives me peace while dancing to the sound of any music is what I love the most. I've been a dancer for as long as I can remember, it has become a part of me.
